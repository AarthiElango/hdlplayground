12-11-2025 Meeting Discussion About HDL Playground

1) Flexible Compilation Options- No strict dependency for both design and testbench files to compile together

Commands:
iverilog -o out design.v testbench.v ( for compiling both the design file and the testbench together. )
iverilog -o out design.v ( Used when you only want to check or compile the design file only (no testbench). )
iverilog -o out testbench.v ( Used when you only want to check or compile the  testbench (no Design) ).

 2)Console output File

Command:
 vvp out ( Compiles both files into a single simulation executable (out). )

 3) initially editor view before authentication - no. basic setup is collapsing  
 4) Make Option For Project autosave on editor 
 5) Option To Create multiple files on design and testbench  
 6) github (Integration In Future)
 7)  For Waveform We Will also Run and Check In Fliplot , any issues are there we will Update 

      8)  Ew skills credential ( https://www.ewskills.com/ )
